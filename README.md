# Detect-Session-Gateway
This little thing will detect sessions connected to your token. It also keeps logs.

# Small Disclaimer
This will detect any changes to your token, e.g if someone logged in while your using the script it will log it. If you want to force it to log the current people on the session, you will have to force a rich presence update, e.g `Playing ...` or `Streaming ...`, it can also be games that force this update too.
