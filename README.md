## Detect Session Gateway
This script will detect changes in your session using Discords built in Gateway.

### What does this log?
- [x] Discord build version
- [x] Operating System
- [x] Client version
- [x] Session ID
- [ ] Location of Login
- [ ] OS Version


## Small Disclaimer
This will report any changes to your gateway, such as if someone logged in while you were running the script.
If you want it to log the current individuals in the session, you'll need to force a rich presence update, such as Playing or Streaming; Games can force this update.
